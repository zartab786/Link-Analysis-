# Link-Analysis-
This computes the importance of nodes or user in a email community by calculating its Pagerank, hub and authority scores for a dataset of email network. 

Data Description:
The network was generated using email data from a large European research institution. They
have anonymized information about all incoming and outgoing email between members of the
research institution. There is an edge (u, v) in the network if person u sent person v at least one
email. The e-mails only represent communication between institution members (the core), and
the dataset does not contain incoming messages from or outgoing messages to the rest of the
world.
Dataset Statistics:
Total Nodes= 1005
Total Edges = 25571
